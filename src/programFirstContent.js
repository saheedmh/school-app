Thanks to our voluntary mentors, we offer our students a career guiding journey when graduating from our program. Each student has its own mentor, who helps with updating their CV and LinkedIn profile, writing a motivation letter, doing a mock interview, and leading them through the job-hunting jungle in the IT sector</p>
